# Wind Downscaling Project

## Datasets: 

* ERA5 reanalysis from ECMWF: global gridded dataset from 1979 - today with a spatial resolution of 25 x 25 km and a 1-hourly temporal resolution    
freely available at: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/search?type=dataset&text=era5
* ECMWF recently released ERA5-Land. It is the land component of ERA5 with a spatial resolution of 9 km high-resolution topographic descriptors (DEM) freely available: https://geovite.ethz.ch/DigitalElevationModels.html 
* COSMO-1 anaylsis from MeteoSwiss: gridded dataset from 2016 - today with ~1 km resolution and a 1-hourly temporal resolution
*coming soon* 
* MeteoSwiss Station Data SwissMetNet: https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home/measurement-and-forecasting-systems/land-based-stations/automatisches-messnetz.html
